    "aboutContent":"Meet Errol Shardelow, the visionary behind Helix Scalar, VoiceSense, and VoiceNotes. With a solid foundation in Electronics Engineering and over two decades as a dedicated full-time practitioner, Errol has meticulously fine-tuned his research to develop proprietary frequency programs. These programs have demonstrated remarkable benefits in sessions as brief as 30 minutes. Imagine the possibilities when your cells are empowered to reach their full potential through the cumulative effects of regular Helix Scalar use. Experience the future of wellness with our innovative solutions.",
    "bottomSectionText":"The discovery and history of Scalar Energy goes back to James Clark Maxwell in the 19th century.Many years later, Nikola Tesla demonstrated the existence of Scalar energy. Later Einstein acknowledged the existence of Scalar energy which later led to the discovery and development of Quantum Physics. In the later years, Andrija Puharich concluded that Scalar Wave energy could enhance both endocrine and immune systems. Another researcher, Dr. Glen Rein, observed that human lymphocytes exposed to Scalar Waves showed improved cellular regeneration and DNA synthesis that naturally stimulated repair processes. These experiments and studies proved that Scalar Waves have the potential to positively improve the immune systemâ€™s response in the human body."
